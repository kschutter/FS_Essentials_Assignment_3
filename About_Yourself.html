    <h1>About Yourself</h1>
    <p id="intro">I am a student attending Miami University studying computer science. I am in my third year of classes, 
        and enjoy coding. Before that, I went to high school at Centaurus High School, and attained the 
        International Baccalaureate degree. I don't have a specific preferance with how I plan on using a computer
        science degree, only that security and artificial intelligence seems interesting.

                I also enjoy coding personal projects when I can, I am currently working on a deck builder for a card game
                and an RPG style video game.
